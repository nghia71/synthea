# Canada

This folder contains the configuration files for Canada.

Data was sourced from Statistics Canada websites.

Specifically the 2016 census data (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/GetFile.cfm?Lang=E&FILETYPE=CSV&GEONO=044)
and the Open Database of Healthcare Facilities (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/lode/databases/odhf).

The timezone data, zip/postal codes, and latitude/longitude data are functional, but should be viewed with suspicion.
